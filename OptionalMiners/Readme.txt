Readme for Optional Miners

The miner.ps1 files in this folder can be used with NPlusMiner.
However, they are not included by default in the miner folder for a variety of reasons.

These specific miner files are for advanced users and usually require that the miner program is downloaded manually and placed in the proper folder.

These might not have been fully tested. Use at your own risk.
